# Ironhhack WebDev Project #2: Wonka's Emporium

Wonka Emporium in a chocolate and candy e-commerce application developed as a project for Ironhack's WedDev Full Stack Course. This Single Page Application (SPA) was developed in REACT, using additional libraries from Material-UI and a third-party API called "Commerce.js".

Wonka Emporium was inspired by Ronald Dahl's book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and its movie adaptations. All products were extracted from the source material and our SPA is chock-full of references to the source material and we invite you to discover all of them. Unfortunately, the products are still all fictional, but Oompa Loompas are working hard on making them real ;).

We claim no ownership to the rights of Ronald Dahl's work or estate and this is merely an exercise in coding.

## Acknowledgments

After 3 weeks of intense studying, coding and trial-and-error the group managed to develop a fully functional e-commerce SPA. It would not have been possible without the invaluable help from our teacher Henrique Mendes and our teacher assistants Flávia Maia and Henrique Morikawa. We also extend our thanks to coding YouTube and StackExchange communities.

## Prerequisites

## How to navigate

The Home page of our SPA will present you with a Navigation Bar, a Footer and, sandwiched between them, all of our Wonkalicious candies and chocolates. Simply press the shopping cart icon beneath the items you desire. Once you are done, click on the shopping cart icon located in the Navigation Bar (which will be indicating the amount of items you desire to purchase) and this will take you to the Your Cart page. Review that you have all desired items, or remove the ones you don't wish to buy, and click on "Proceed to checkout" button. Now, provide your shipping address information, click on the "Next" button and provide your payment information. Finally, review your shopping cart information and, if it's all nice and dandy, click the "Pay" button. Thank you for your purchase! Should you desire anything else, click on the "Back to Home" button and fill your shopping cart to your heart's content!

## Additional implementations and improvements

This SPA is fully functional in its current state, but we believe that the next steps would be valuable to improve user's experience:

* Fully implement the log-in function (content not yet seen in this course);
* Add a Product's Detail REACT component;
* Add a Suggested Products REACT component.
